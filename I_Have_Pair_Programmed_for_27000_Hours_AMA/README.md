# I Have Pair Programmed for 27,000 Hours: Ask Me Anything!

It's true! I've pair programmed eight hours per day, five days per week, about 50 weeks per year for the last 13 1/2 years. For the past three and a half years I've even *remote pair programmed* from my home office full time.

I've given presentations at many conferences, Meetups, and companies on topics ranging from Agile team management to Android messaging frameworks. My presentations inevitably grind to a halt once I mention that I pair program: I'm peppered with questions!

Are you ready? ***Let's do this thing.*** What is pair programming? Won't software projects take twice as long or cost twice as much with pair programming? Do I pair with the same person every day? Who owns the code? How do performance reviews work? Do we pair on *everything?* What do I do if my pair goes home sick? What do I do if I can't stand my pair?

What if my pair smells bad? What if my pair smells GOOD?!

I'll answer any and all questions about pair programming and remote pair programming, from the profound to the silly. I have no doubt that we will fill the allotted time with sage advice, educational anecdotes, and your own stories about pair programming.

***Ask me anything!***

# Notes
While this is not a technology-themed talk, it will surely drive lively conversations and add a little variety to the conference.
